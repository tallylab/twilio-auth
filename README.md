# Twilio Auth
> Second Factor Auth for Distributed Systems using Twilio

This module hashes and salts a valid and verified phone number and returns a NaCL sr25519 keypair
based on the generated seed. It is currently used in the
[Remote Education Log](https://log.education).

## Install

### Prerequisites

Usage of this module requires a **Twilio account** as well as a working **Verify Service**.

1. Create an account at https://twilio.com
2. Go to https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings and get your account SID and Auth token
from the **LIVE Credentials** section (Verify does not work with TEST Credentials)
2. Go to https://www.twilio.com/console/verify/services and add a new service

### Configuration

At the end of the above process, you should have the values you need for these three environment
variables:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=[Account SID taken from LIVE credentials on settings page]
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=[Auth token from LIVE credentials on settings page]
TWILIO_VERIFY_SID=[Service of your Twilio Verify Service]
```

Then, generate a strong salt value and use that for the `SALT` environment variable.

Finally choose an `HTTP_HOST` and `HTTP_PORT`.

## Usage

Now let's put those variables to use!

First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tallylab/twilio-auth
```

### Running with node.js

1. Create an .env file, see .env.example for the required configuration keys.
2. `npm start`

### Running with Docker

This repo also comes with a `Dockerfile` which would allow you to package and build this.

Note that this automatically sets `HTTP_HOST` to `0.0.0.0` and `HTTP_PORT` to `3000` so you
don't need to worry about those.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e SALT=[your salt] \
  -e TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=[enter account sid] \
  -e TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=[your auth token] \
  -e TWILIO_VERIFY_SID=[your verify service id] \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --name twilio-auth \
  tallylab/twilio-auth:latest
```
